# Hexapawn
 My goal was to create Hexapawn and make AI as opponent of the user, which getting smarter after all lose game. I reach my goal, and after playing 20 minutes with my algorithm,
AI became invincible. Seriously, it becomes mathematically impossible to defeat.

# Description
 Hexapawn, is a simple game, very simple. At first, you have 3x3 board, at bottom your three pawn is placed in row and your opponent's three pawn at the top.

 Pawns can be moved forward, if place is not occupied and they can move diagonally, only if they take opponent's pawn.
 
 There is three ways to win:
  1. reach end of the board,
  2. kill all the opponent's pawns,
  3. leave opponent without moves.

# Getting started
 If you want to run my game at your device for some reasons, you just need to clone my project and run Launch.py.
 
 AI is already smart, so you have to delete moves.json to start from fresh.
 
# Using
 When you click at blue square, it becomes more lighter, which means you select figure and you can move it, by clicking valid position.
 When you click again at selected figure, it unselects and you can't move it, before you click again.
 If you accidentally select wrong figure, you can click right one and it becomes selected automatically.
 
 After You make move, AI choose it's moves and you can see how it's selects red figures and makes moves.
 
 Text at the top of the board, shows which turn to play(Blue or Red) and if game ends, It shows winner.
 
 If someone wins game, it shows you the winner and shuts down.
